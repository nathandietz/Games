*Spymasters know the secret identities of 25 agents. Their teammates know the agents only by their codenames. Spymasters take turns giving one-word clues. A clue may relate to multiple words on the table. The field operatives try to guess which words their spymaster meant. When a field operative touches a word, the spymaster reveals its secret identity. If the field operatives guess correctly, they may continue guessing, until they run out of ideas for the given clue or until they hit a wrong person. Then it is the other team's turn to give a clue and guess. The first team to contact all their agents wins the game.*

https://secrethitler.io/  
*It is pre-war Germany, and the political fight between the Fascists and Liberals is raging. Each party wishes to enact policies in line with their own agenda; if they enact enough, then the country will be under their control. Although the Fascists are outnumbered, they also remain hidden, and none more hidden than Hitler himself. If Hitler is elected Chancellor after only a few Fascist policies are in effect, the Fascists will seize control immediately. The Liberals might have to play dirty in order to stop this, enacting Fascist policies to perform investigations, and even to make an assassinattion attempt on Hitler himself.*


### Spyfall
https://netgames.io/games/spyfall/  
*There is a spy among you, and you have met to uncover them. You all share a piece of knowledge: the location of this strange meeting. All except the spy. Use this knowledge to weed the spy out, but don't let them discover your location or the consequences will be dire.*


### Love Letter
https://netgames.io/games/love-letter/  
*Love Letter is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2–4 players. Your goal is to get your love letter into Princess Annette's hands while deflecting the letters from competing suitors. From a deck with only sixteen cards, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, trying to expose others and knock them from the game. Powerful cards lead to early gains, but make you a target. Rely on weaker cards for too long, however, and your letter may be tossed in the fire!*


### Avalon

*The Loyal Servants of Arthur are on a quest for the Holy Grail. However, the evil Minions of Mordred are amidst the good, and they wish to destroy their prize.

Can the quest succeed despite the treachery afoot?*
